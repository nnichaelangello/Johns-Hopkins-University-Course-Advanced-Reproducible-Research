# Advanced Reproducible Research: NOAA Storm Database Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains my submission for the **Reproducible Research** course offered by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera. The project analyzes the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Storm Database to evaluate the impact of severe weather events across the United States from 1950 to November 2011. The analysis addresses two key questions: (1) which types of weather events are most harmful to population health (fatalities and injuries), and (2) which types have the greatest economic consequences (property and crop damage). The results are presented in a reproducible R Markdown document, processed into HTML and published on RPubs.

## Repository Contents
- **`Storm_Analysis.Rmd`**: The R Markdown source file containing all code, data processing, and analysis.
- **`Storm_Analysis.html`**: The HTML output of the analysis for easy viewing in a browser.
- **`StormData.csv.bz2`**: The raw NOAA Storm Database file (47Mb), compressed using bzip2.
- **`figure/`**: Directory containing plots generated during the analysis (e.g., bar plots for health and economic impacts).

## Analysis Objectives
1. **Data Loading and Processing**: Load the raw `StormData.csv.bz2` file into R and transform it for analysis, focusing on event types, health impacts, and economic damages.
2. **Health Impact Assessment**: Identify the top weather events causing fatalities and injuries.
3. **Economic Impact Assessment**: Determine the top weather events leading to property and crop damage.
4. **Visualization and Summary**: Present findings using two bar plots and a summary table to aid municipal resource prioritization.

## Key Findings
- **Health Impact**: Tornadoes are the most harmful to population health, causing the highest combined fatalities and injuries.
- **Economic Impact**: Floods result in the greatest economic consequences, with the largest total damages in billions of USD.

## How to Reproduce the Analysis
To replicate this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nnichaelangello/Johns-Hopkins-University-Course-Advanced-Reproducible-Research.git
   ```

2. **Set Up R Environment:**
   - Install R and RStudio if not already installed ([R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)).
   - Install required R packages:
     ```R
     install.packages(c("knitr", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr"), repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com/")
     ```

3. **Process the R Markdown File:**
   - Open `Storm_Analysis.Rmd` in RStudio.
   - Ensure `StormData.csv.bz2` is in the same directory.
   - Click the **Knit** button in RStudio, or run:
     ```R
     library(knitr)
     knit2html("Storm_Analysis.Rmd")
     ```
   - This will generate `Storm_Analysis.html` and a `figure/` folder with plots.

4. **View Results:**
   - Open `Storm_Analysis.html` in a web browser to see the full report, including code, plots, and findings.

## RPubs Publication
The analysis has been published on RPubs for public access:
- **URL**: [https://rpubs.com/Michael_Angello/1290913](https://rpubs.com/Michael_Angello/1290913)  
  *(Note: Replace with your actual RPubs URL after publishing.)*

## Notes
- The dataset is large (902,297 rows), so processing may take several minutes depending on your system's capabilities.
- The `cache = TRUE` option in the Rmd file speeds up subsequent knitting by caching results.
- For issues with RPubs, an alternative PDF version can be generated by changing the output to `pdf_document` in the Rmd header and knitting again.
